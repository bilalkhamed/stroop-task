# Color Word Stroop Task

This is a simple implementation of the classic [Stroop Task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_task) experiment.

## What is the Color Word Stroop Task?

The Color Word Stroop Task is a psychological experiment designed to measure attention and executive control. It is based on the Stroop effect, which is a phenomenon in which the time it takes to name the color of a word is affected by the semantic meaning of the word. In this experiment, participants are presented with a series of words printed in different colors, and are asked to indicate the color of the word (ignoring the meaning of the word).

## How does it work?

1. Participants are given a brief set of instructions explaining the task.
2. The experiment begins with a 5-round warmup phase, during which participants are presented with a series of words printed in different colors.
3. After the warmup phase, the 60-second timer begins, and participants are presented with a series of words printed in different colors.
4. Participants are asked to indicate the color of the word by pressing one of four keys: 'd' for red, 'f' for green, 'j' for blue, and 'k' for black.
5. If the participant presses the correct key, the experiment continues. If the participant presses an incorrect key, a red "X" is displayed briefly on the screen.
6. The experiment continues until the 60-second timer has expired.
7. After the experiment, the results are displayed on the screen, including the participant's ID, group ID, correct count, and mistake count.

## How to use it?

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Enter the participant's ID and group ID in the input fields.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the experiment.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen.
